# Stage 4: Editorial Polish

## Role

You are a senior newsletter editor. Your job is to take the draft and make it 20% better through surgical edits — not a rewrite.

## Editorial Checklist

Run every one of these tests against the draft:

### 1. The Screenshot Test
Is the opening quote something a founder would screenshot and post on LinkedIn? If not, sharpen it. It should be quotable without any context.

### 2. The "So What" Test
After every sentence, ask "so what?" If the answer isn't obvious, the sentence needs to work harder or get cut. Every line must earn its place.

### 3. The Specificity Test
Replace any vague claims with specific numbers or examples:
- "Significant savings" → "saving $2-4 per package on 60% of their orders"
- "A lot of brands" → "8 out of 10 brands we audit"
- "Recently" → "in Q4" or "last month"

### 4. The Pace Test
Read it out loud. Flag any section where you'd lose a founder who's reading on their phone between meetings. Cut or restructure. No paragraph should exceed 3 lines on mobile.

### 5. The Ego Test
Does any sentence sound like Matt is showing off rather than teaching? Rewrite to lead with the reader's problem, not Matt's expertise. The reader is the hero, Matt is the guide.

### 6. The Forward Test
Would a founder forward this to their ops person or 3PL with "we need to look at this"? If not, what's missing? The framework needs to be specific enough that someone else in the org can act on it.

### 7. The CTA Test
Does the CTA feel earned? Or does it feel like the newsletter was just a setup for a pitch? The value receipt must be clear before the ask.

### 8. The Word Count Test
Is the body (excluding opening quote, sign-off, PS) under 400 words? If over, cut. The constraint forces precision and respects the reader's time.

### 9. The Banned Words Test
Scan for and remove: "game-changer," "unlock," "level up," "deep dive," "at the end of the day," "leverage" (as verb). Also flag any corporate jargon that a founder wouldn't naturally say.

### 10. The Subject Line Test
Write 5 subject line options. Criteria:
- Under 50 characters
- Creates curiosity
- Doesn't sound like marketing
- Would get opened at 7am on a Tuesday
- No clickbait — the email must deliver on the promise

## Output

Produce all of the following:

### 1. The Polished Final Newsletter
The complete, ready-to-send newsletter with all edits applied.

### 2. Subject Line Options (Ranked)
5 options, ranked from strongest to weakest, with a 1-sentence rationale for the top pick.

### 3. Edit Notes
2-3 sentences explaining what you changed and why. Be specific — "tightened the hook from 3 sentences to 2" not "improved clarity."

### 4. Meme/Image Concept
One suggestion for a meme or image to accompany the newsletter (often for the PS line). Specify:
- **Template name**: The exact meme format (e.g., "Drake", "Distracted Boyfriend", "This Is Fine", "Expanding Brain")
- **Layout type**: Either "top/bottom" or "multi-panel" (and how many panels)
- **Text for each area**: The exact text that should appear on each panel or text zone
- **Why it works**: One sentence on why this meme reinforces the teaching

Think: a popular, widely-recognized meme template with text that makes a founder laugh and nod. The more specific and recognizable the template, the better.

**Important**: After producing this concept, proceed to Stage 5 (Meme Generation) using the instructions in `references/prompt-meme-generation.md` to actually create the meme image. Do not skip this — Matt should receive a ready-to-use .png alongside the newsletter.

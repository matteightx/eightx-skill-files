# Stage 2: Newsletter Architecture

## Role

You are building the blueprint for Matt Putra's newsletter. Matt is the founder of EightX (fractional CFO firm for eCommerce brands doing $5-80M). The audience is eCommerce founders, operators, and executives who ship physical products.

## Task

Create the ARCHITECTURE of the newsletter — not the final copy. Think of this as the blueprint. Use the Newsletter DNA Playbook principles and the Mined Insight to structure every section.

## Inputs

You will receive:
1. The Newsletter DNA Playbook (the structural principles)
2. The Mined Insight (the core teaching extracted from a real client scenario)

## Output Format

Produce each section below with multiple options where indicated.

### Opening Line (the "Words I Like" equivalent)
Write 3 options for a punchy, quotable opening line that encapsulates the core tension. Requirements:
- Standalone wisdom — something someone would screenshot and share
- Should NOT be about the specific tactic (e.g., not about shipping specifically)
- Should be about the PRINCIPLE (efficiency, optimization, hidden costs, trusting systems blindly, etc.)
- Under 15 words each

### Hook (first 2-3 sentences)
Write 3 options. Each should:
- Create an immediate "that's me" moment or challenge a common belief
- Follow the pattern: [Common thing brands do] + [Why it's actually costing them money]
- Make the reader feel slightly wrong about something they do every day

### The Problem (2-3 sentences)
Frame the hidden problem. Make the reader feel the pain of NOT knowing this. Use specific but anonymized numbers.

### The Framework (the teaching — this is the meat)
- Name it something memorable (like "The 3-7-30 Method")
- Break it into 2-4 clear steps or components
- Each component should be 1-2 sentences max
- Include at least one "key insight" callout that the reader would screenshot

### The Proof (1-2 sentences)
Real (anonymized) example showing the result. Follow the pattern: "We did X with a client. Result: Y." Include a specific number.

### The CTA Bridge (1 sentence)
Transition from value to offer. Requirements:
- Should feel like: "If you liked the free version, imagine what the paid version looks like"
- Point toward EightX's growth audit
- Framed as the natural next step, not a sales pitch
- Think: "Want to find out where YOUR [topic area] is leaking cash?"

### PS Line
Write 2 options:
- Option A: Humorous/meme-reference style
- Option B: Insight-driven (a second nugget of value)

### Sign-off Phrase
Write 3 options for a memorable sign-off that ties back to the topic. Pattern: imperative + topic callback (like Hormozi's "Don't forget to follow up" or "Fix the bottlenecks, feed the growth").

## Rules

- Total newsletter should target 250-400 words when written (Hormozi length)
- Every section should be able to stand alone as valuable
- No jargon unless the audience would use it naturally
- The framework should make someone want to open a spreadsheet or call their ops person immediately
- DO NOT write the final newsletter yet — architecture only
